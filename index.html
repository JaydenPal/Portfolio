                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Jayden Palacios and I am an undergraduate student pursing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus in software engineering at The University of San Antonio.
                         I am looking to gain experience on team-based, or individual, projects. I am a fast learner and wiling to put in the extra effort to understand difficult concepts.</p>
                    <p>I am currently studying Data Science and general software engineering. While I have used JavaScript for front-end development in the past, 
                        I have most recently used C for projects in school regarding data strcutures and algorithms. I am also currently learning Java in my Applications Programming 
                        class to, well, build applications. In regards to data science, I am using Pyhton with spyder for my studies. I also have experience using github version control.
                        Not only am I looking to hone these skills, but I am also trying to expand my knowledge regarding back-end development. I have worked with RESTful API's in projects 
                        before but I would love to get under the hood and learn how to contruct one myself. I have even attempted this using node.js but I would need a lot more practice to 
                        say I confidently understand it. While my skills fall largely fall under web development / data structures and algorithms, I would like to learn new skills and technologies to branch into different areas of tech. </p>
                    <p>Outside of programming, I love to travel and explore the great outdoors. On the right you can see my poorly taken selfie at Macchu Piccu.
                         I go camping and hiking all the time and along the way I have met a fair share of digital nomads who have inspired me to do one day do the same.
                        For right now though, Im looking for a team, company, or place I can call home and better myself as a software engineer.</p>

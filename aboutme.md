### About me

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast trying to develop my skills in Reverse Engineering,
malware analysis, and Digital Forensics/incident response. My skills have been 
developed via courses at the University of Texas at San Antonio and CTF settings.

Even though my bachelor's degree coming to an end, my studies will continue as I delve
further into the world of malware and DFIR. I am hoping to begin analyzing and doing reports
on publicly available malware samples. 

My studies have also brought me to the intersection of data science and cybersecurity. I am 
working on implementing a proposed model for malware classification that I was not able to 
complete during my last semester of school. Many more projects are sure to come with time that
will no longer be dedicated to school. 

Ultimately, I am looking for an organization the plant myself so that I can continue to develop
the skills and experience with the tools needed to be successful in cybersecurity. I love 
researching and reading binaries. Mostly, I just like to get my hands on something and work with 
it, which is why I appreciate DFIR and RE so much. Cybersecurity satiates my itch for problem-solving while making a real impact on the world around me, protecting people in the ever-expanding domain of cyberspace.

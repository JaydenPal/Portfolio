        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>I am a cybersecurity enthusiast trying to develop my skills in Reverse Engineering,
            malware analysis, and Digital Forensics/incident response. My skills have been 
            developed via courses at the University of Texas at San Antonio and CTF settings.
        </p>
        <p>Even though my bachelor's degree coming to an end, my studies will continue as I delve
            further into the world of malware and DFIR. I am hoping to begin analyzing and doing reports
            on publicly available malware samples. 
        </p>
        <p>My studies have also brought me to the intersection of data science and cybersecurity. I am 
            working on implementing a proposed model for malware classification that I was not able to 
            complete during my last semester of school. Many more projects are sure to come with time that
            will no longer be dedicated to school. 
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, I am looking for an organization the plant myself so that I can continue to develop
            the skills and experience with the tools needed to be successful in cybersecurity. I love 
            researching and reading binaries. Mostly, I just like to get my hands on something and work with 
            it, which is why I appreciate DFIR and RE so much. Cybersecurity satiates my itch for problem-solving
            while making a real impact on the world around me, protecting people in the ever-expanding domain of cyberspace. 
        </p>
